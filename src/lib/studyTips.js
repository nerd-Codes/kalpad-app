    "Use the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused study, followed by a 5-minute break. It's a marathon, not a sprint!",
    "Explain a concept to a friend (or a rubber duck!). Teaching is the best way to solidify your own understanding.",
    "Don't just re-read your notes. Use active recall methods like flashcards or quizzes to test your memory.",
